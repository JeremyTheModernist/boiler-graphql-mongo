# GraphQL-MongoDB Boilerplate

## This repository provides a standard boiler plate for GraphQL and MongoDB.

I recommend following [my docs](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ccbo8pwfdqhftffbpziuo/Express-MongoDB-GraphQL.paper?dl=0&rlkey=k2ckbx5pk813f79h3poi5opnx) in Dropbox Paper, to get more context around how I've built this.

You will also notice a `public` folder which is responsible for a very lofi front end portion of my site. It's primary purpose to provide some content when the user first hits the page.
